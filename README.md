# Web Dev
With [Web Dev](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/id/6e3b4b0d7d1aebde/), users of the Google Assistant can ask for data from [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com).
This data is provided by the [caniuse repository](https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse).

## Contributing

## The Code
I use [Dialogflow.com](https://dialgogflow.com) to resolve the user querys.

### Actions on Google Helper
I use my own little [helper](https://github.com/richtepa/google_assistant-api.ai-php_helper). When an intent is triggered, it executes the function in the [index.php](index.php).
